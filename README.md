1. The folder named "traces" contains the real Lightning dataset we used for experiments. This portion of the data is sourced from https://github.com/NetX-lab/Offchain-routing-traces-and-code/tree/master.

2. The Python file named "algorithms.py" contains all the algorithms that we have proposed in the paper:
   	+ alg_exact: the exact algorithm used in experiments.
   	+ alg_baseline_random: the random baseline algorithm used in experiments.
   	+ alg_baseline_greedy: the greedy baseline algorithm used in experiments.
   	+ alg_revive_exact_new_pc: the revive algorithm used in experiments.
   	+ alg_DC: the algorithm, namely UAR_DC, proposed in our paper.
   	+ alg_circuit_greedy_table_new: the algorithm, namely Circuit Greedy, proposed in our paper.
