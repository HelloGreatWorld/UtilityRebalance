## Ripple Trace 
Topology and transaction trace are downloaded from [SpeedyMurmurs website](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/software/speedymurmurs/download.php).
Due to the quote limitations of Github, we put the transaction file to [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yj2jvx6r8e9jad4/transactions-in-USD-jan-2013-aug-2016.txt?dl=0)
